Block annoying ads on sites like Facebook, YouTube and all other websites.\n\nAdblock Plus blocks all annoying ads, and supports websites by not blocking unobtrusive ads by default (configurable).","fullDescription":"Get the free ad blocker for Firefox. With almost 500 million downloads to date!\n\n✓ Block annoying ads and popups\n✓ Block video ads on sites like YouTube\n✓ Speed-up loading time on pages\n✓ Reduce risk of \"malvertising\" infections\n✓ Protect your privacy by stopping trackers from following your online activity\n✓ Block social media icons tracking\n\nThe ad blocker's additional features enable you to easily support your favorite websites by whitelisting them, to add or create your own filters, and to block social media icons tracking.\n\nAdblock Plus supports the Acceptable Ads initiative. Acceptable Ads are shown by default, which helps support websites that rely on advertising revenue but choose to only display nonintrusive ads. This can be disabled at any time for users who wish to block all ads. The initiative allows content producers to receive monetization for their work and helps create an environment of fairness and sustainability for user, advertiser, and creator alike.
